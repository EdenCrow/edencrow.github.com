Hi! My name is Eden and I am a technology enthusiast from Cambridge, UK. I have studied Computing & Computer Science at De Montfort and Reading. Previously, I have created [FreakingWeirdMusicVideos](http://freakingweirdmusicvideos.com) (sharing the weirdest and wackiest music videos) and [EdenReviews](http://edenreviews.com) (critiquing games, music, movies and TV).  I have dabbled with both Unity and website development. Currently I am learning about smart home automation, computer networking and systems administration with technologies including Home Assistant, Linux, Docker and more. In my blog you can find my attempts to document the progress of this learning, while I write primarily for my own benefit and to solidify my understandings, it may have some interesting tidbits and ideas to springboard into your own experiments. A good starting point is my first post on setting up this website.
