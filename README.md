# EdenCrow.info
This repository hosts my personal homepage, which can be found at [https://edencrow.info](https://edencrow.info).

The project uses [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to build a static website.

It uses [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) by Luiz F. A. de Pr√° for its theme.

The site is hosted with the use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Source Folder
The `_src` folder contains the source files for the website *before* it has been built with Hugo.

Note that the *extended version* of Hugo is required to process the `SCSS` files.
