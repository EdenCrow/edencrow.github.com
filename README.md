# EdenCrow.info
This repository hosts my personal homepage, which can be found at [https://edencrow.info](https://edencrow.info).

The project uses [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) to build a static website.

It uses [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) by Luiz F. A. de Pr√° for its theme.

The site is hosted with the use of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
