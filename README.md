# EdenCrow.info
This repository hosts my personal homepage, which can be found at [https://edencrow.info](https://edencrow.info).

The project uses Hugo to generate a static website.

It uses Hugo Coder for its theme.

The site is hosted with the use of GitHub Pages.

## Folder Structure
The `src` folder contains the source files for the website before it has been built with Hugo.

The `live` folder contains the site files built by Hugo.
