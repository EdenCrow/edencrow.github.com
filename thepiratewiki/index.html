		<h1>The Pirate Wiki</h1>
		The idea of <i>The Pirate Wiki</i> is to have a MediaWiki powered website that informs users about Piracy, including everything from an explanation of Torrenting to The Pirate Party and even streatching to hacking.
		However, to be able to do the project we need volunteer writers and somewhere to call the site home. If you think you can lend a hand then please send Eden an e-mail at <a href="mailto:EdenC@dev-hq.net">EdenC@dev-hq.net</a>
